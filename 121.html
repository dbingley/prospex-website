<h5>The problem</h5>
<p>
  Many schools do not have the resources to offer learning mentors or individual support for young people. Often, neither do their parents. Growing up is hard enough; if they see their families struggling and their own prospects feel bleak, it is even harder. Worry can turn to frustration and quickly, to anger: this can lead to poorer attainments at school, or cause harm to their mental health.
</p>
<h5>What we offer</h5>

<p>We allocate young people a Dedicated One2One worker based on their needs and circumstances. Our One2one work could range from a few sessions helping a young person complete a application form, to many years working with them and their families to help overcome a range of complex issues which, together, can have a serious impact on their wellbeing.
Most of our One2One referrals come from our own work streams. As such, we can start from a place of mutual respect and not have to spend multiple sessions getting to know the young person and building trust.
</p>
<h5>Outcomes</h5>

<p>Through regular one-to-one sessions with their personal worker, young people have a constant in their life – someone who will listen to them, encourage them, raise their aspirations and give them the confidence to overcome what is holding them back from reaching their potential. Our flexible approach allows our workers to meet and communicate with their young person whenever suits both parties, even if this means meeting outside of the normal arranged times.

<p><b>A mother’s email to us --</b>
<i>“I would like to take the opportunity to thank you for all your help and support for my son and family over the last 5 years. When I first contacted Prospex to turn my son around not only did you come to my home, you asked me what I would like from our meetings. I said, ‘I wanted to get my son back and off the streets.’ At the time he was constantly being arrested and had made bad choices with friends. By meeting with him weekly and supporting us as a family you have changed his attitude, his behaviour and his general persona. I feel you have gone over and above for my son, believed in him and given him the tools he needs in life. I am truly thankful.”
